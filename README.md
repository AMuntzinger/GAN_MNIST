## Creating Handwritten Digits with GANs

This project generates new handwritten digits with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in PyTorch. It is trained on the MNIST dataset http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. 

The notebook is an exercise of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

### Instructions

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- torch
